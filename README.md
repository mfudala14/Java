 I used JavaFX to create a bookshop management system
 that was designed in IntelliJ using Visual Paradigm for
 design support and MySQL Workbench for database
 integration. The system used design patterns, database
 normalisation, and MVC architecture to produce an
 adaptable and stable application that supported JDBC
 databases and file serialisation.

Book store management system 
 I used JavaFX to create a bookshop management system
 that was designed in IntelliJ using Visual Paradigm for
 design support and MySQL Workbench for database
 integration. The system used design patterns, database
 normalisation, and MVC architecture to produce an
 adaptable and stable application that supported JDBC
 databases and file serialisation. 

Linear Data Structure Implementation
 I completed a Java projects assigment1 and assigment2 in IntelliJ that used divide
 and-conquer and greedy algorithms, as well as linked
 lists, stacks, and queues. I covered MergeSort,
 QuickSort, binary search, Towers of Hanoi, activity
 selection, and Huffman coding, demonstrating
 understanding of efficient and modular code design
